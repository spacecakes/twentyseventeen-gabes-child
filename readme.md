## Description

This is a custom variant of Twenty Seventeen for use on [gabriellundmark.com](). It brings larger font sizes and different fonts and colors, and provides a simplified layout for a more print-like experience. It also removes comments and (optionally) headers with the use of templates, as well as providing fullscreen layouts for use with large images.
